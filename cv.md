  ```const lifePathNumber = dateOfBirth => {
  while (String(dateOfBirth).length > 1) {
    let str = String(dateOfBirth);
    let strArr = str.split(""), strTemp=0;
    for (i=0; i < strArr.length; i++) {
      if (!isNaN(strArr[i])) {
        strTemp+=parseInt(strArr[i]);
      }
      dateOfBirth = strTemp;
    }
  }
  return dateOfBirth
}```
```function evenOrOdd(str) {
  const e = str.split('').filter(a=>+a%2==0).reduce((a,b)=>+a + +b, 0);
  const o = str.split('').filter(a=>+a%2!=0).reduce((a,b)=>+a + +b, 0);
  return (e > o) ? 'Even is greater than Odd' : (e < o) ? 'Odd is greater than Even' : 'Even and Odd are the same';
}```
